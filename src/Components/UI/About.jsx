            <br></br>
            Iâ€™m Soufian Boukir, a digital development student at ISTA Tiznit, passionate about creating innovative projects using React, Laravel, and Express. While I enjoy full-stack development, my long-term focus is on becoming a backend developer, where I aim to design and optimize scalable systems.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I love blending functional design with efficient back-end solutions, building applications that are both user-friendly and technically robust. Outside of coding, I enjoy programming challenges and swimming, which keep my mind and body sharp.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Iâ€™m constantly exploring new technologies to expand my expertise and improve my problem-solving skills. Collaboration and attention to detail are key drivers in my work, as I strive to deliver projects that meet both technical and user needs. I believe that every line of code contributes to creating meaningful digital experiences.
